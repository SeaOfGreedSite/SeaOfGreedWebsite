## This is the new Sea of Greed Website

This site was created by yours truly with the help of Bandit, grant, Quite, and the Internet. Originally it was hosted and built for Heroku, but we have since switched to using Github Pages, as Jekyll gives us a lot more flexibility in creating blog-type posts like this. A new podcast is also in the works to be hosted here and on YouTube hopefully in the near future. I am really excited for what's to come.

## Site Overview

### About

This page originally had a parallax effect to it, but due to compatibility issues with Safari and no guarantee it would look correct in every browser, I decided to move to a static image. On the bright side, this page doesn't lag as much.

### Team

This page was fun to make, and since it was originally made on Heroku, the whole thing was done by scratch. I've just been too lazy to redo it to make it automatic. Team members are allowed to put whatever they'd like in their bio (within reason), including personal social media links and stuff they've worked on for Sea of Greed.

### Blog/Podcast

This page is the most recent addition, and the main reason behind the switch to Github Pages, as doing this with Jekyll is a lot simpler than it is with a CMS, of course I'm still learning a lot about web development and could be wrong in this aspect. There are two types of posts, blogs (like this) and podcasts. My hope for the podcasts is to get a proper RSS feed setup for people to subscribe to alongside them being posted to YouTube.

### Navigation/Social Media Bars

These were fun to make, especially the social media bar, which took a lot of checking and adjusting to get looking right across web browsers, desktop, and mobile.  I'm still unsure of whether the site works 100% everywhere, but it at least works really well on the devices I use, and the devices of the friends I bother.
