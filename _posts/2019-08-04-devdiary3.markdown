With a [flurry of keystrokes and some last minute hacking](https://youtu.be/2vN8g9aMO_M?t=3), the devs behind Sea of Greed cooked up something extra spicy for you all this time: A real working play test of [_Sea of Greed_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0Lf4maORAS8xzzj_szm5RqJR9ki64l5/view?usp=sharing)!

That’s right it’s time for you to put your hands on your keyboard and start running and jumping with Wally!

Bandit, lead programmer, completed the dialogue system over the last couple weeks and the result is not only visually impressive, it’s a big step forward for the game’s development.

Take a look at the [screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/353756193908326402/606814977222770700/ggzzbbAndysnap_513.png)!

It may be a lot to take in at first, but after a quick scan it's actually pretty simple. All the nodes can be easily connected and with the addition of character portraits, figuring out who is saying what is quick and intuitive.

The team also wanted to make sure the play test had a working main menu and enough play space to really have fun with Wally.

The main menu was built, or rather rebuilt, by bandit as well. It may seem like a simple thing, but it gives the whole test feel much more like a game you can play and less like a cool collection of code.

The play area was largely the creative work of Tubs, lead artist. Tubs picked up his paintbrushes, filled in pixels and created a perfectly crumulent space for everyone to play around in.

Really digging into it, all the art assets you see in the play test were done by Tubs and his awesome eye for aesthetics!

Fleshing out the playable area a bit more is the inclusion of a few NPCs and that meant writing new dialogue from writer, Jeromy "Dungwiz" Dickey.

Our resident dunglord lovingly took up the quill and decided to do his part to raise awareness on important issues through the in-game conversations and the dolphin's really out of the bag now.

So what are you waiting for?
