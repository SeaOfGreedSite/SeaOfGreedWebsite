Hey greeders, it’s June, which means it’s a very special month…
That’s right, it’s update month!
It’s also Sunday, so that makes this a Sneak Peek Sunday!
Remember those?
Expect these updates on the first Sunday of every other month.

## Artwork Update

The most noticeable thing to show this time is [the new boat artwork](https://imgur.com/a/sps-1-6-24-kCgfU4d).
It looks much nicer and actually complete than it was in those screenshots from last time.

## Maps

Our newest member of the team, Chara, has been making the map page of the logbook where you can mark down little icons to record anything of interest.
Right now, you can only place parrots.
This map Image is also temp.

## Interactions

Some more dialogue interactions were made for the new upper deck to help encourage exploration.
In addition, we’re figuring out a new font for dialogue.
The old one is fun but hard to read, so we’re testing some out and seeing what sticks.
Maybe we’ll make our own who knows.
Typography is no joke.

## Real Life Stuff

Grant, the original project lead, just graduated college! Yay!

## That’s All

Here's some little sketches to close out
