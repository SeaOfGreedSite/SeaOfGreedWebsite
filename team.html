            <p>I manage the applications for prospective team members, working with team leaders to find people who are a right fit.

            <h4>Game Designer / Writer / Music - July 3, 2017</h4>
            <p>I helped create and develop such characters as [REDACTED] and [DATA EXPUNGED], as well as several game... things,
                (as you can tell I'm not the best with writing on the spot). Also I have been with the project from the very start!
                I want to see through that this fun and unique game experience releases in the best state for all those salty sea-dogs out there!</p>

                and because he deserves it for being a part of the team.</p>

            <h4>Writer / Jack of All Trades - Sep 6, 2017</h4>
            <p>I’ve done a lot of game mechanics work, helped decide on many game design decisions,
                wrote a few songs, messed around with maps and layouts, planned a stable outline that we are currently using as a key to writing.
                I’d like to see Wally grow into a fine, respectable pirate who steals for the good of all and learns to value the friendships he gains on his adventure. Or not.</p>
            <p>I’m your average, run-of-the-mill creative person. IT nerd by day, musician/gamer/weeb by night.</p>

            <p>I take care of map-making, along with structuring the Design department and its volunteers.
                My goals for Sea of Greed are to create an enticing world worth exploring, combat encounters worth fighting,
                and dungeons worth getting lost in, all while taking advantage of the ludicrous narrative and characters.</p>

            <h4>Programming Lead - June 26, 2018</h4>
            <p>I did some stuff here and there, like the quest system, AI, dialogue system, restructured the entire codebase,
                started the 3D age of development. <br>But the greatest one of all is that time I posted a funny ha ha meme and everyone laughed. everyone.</p>
            <p>My goal is to make a fantastic game that would be more than a sizable blip on the gaming radar, so I could proudly go "you see how the game crashes if you swap weapons too fast? I made that".</p>
